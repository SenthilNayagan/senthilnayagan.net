<h1 id="what-is-artificial-intelligence"><a class="to-underline" href="#what-is-artificial-intelligence">What is Artificial Intelligence?</a></h1>
<p>At its core, Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. These intelligent systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. The goal of AI is to create systems that can function autonomously and improve their performance over time through learning and adaptation.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-steps-involved-in-ai-development"><a class="to-underline" href="#high-level-steps-involved-in-ai-development">High-level steps involved in AI development</a></h2>

<h1 id="understanding-the-differences"><a class="to-underline" href="#understanding-the-differences">Understanding the differences</a></h1>
<p>Let’s go over the key concepts in AI, such as models, features, and other essential elements to better understand how AI works.</p>
<h2 id="artificial-intelligence-ai-vs-machine-learning-ml"><a class="to-underline" href="#artificial-intelligence-ai-vs-machine-learning-ml">Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Machine Learning (ML)</a></h2>
<p>The terms “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) and “Machine Learning” (ML)&quot; are often used interchangeably, but they’re not quite the same thing. Think of AI as the <em>grand quest</em><a href="#ref-6" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-6"><sup id="back-to-6">6</sup></a> to create smart machines that can think and act like humans. Meanwhile, ML is a specialized toolkit within this quest, equipping machines with the ability to <em>learn and adapt from data</em>, much like how we humans evolve through experiences.</p>
<h3 id="key-differences-ai-vs-ml"><a class="to-underline" href="#key-differences-ai-vs-ml">Key Differences: AI vs. ML</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Breadth
<ul>
<li>AI is the overarching discipline that includes all methods to make machines intelligent.</li>
<li>ML is a specific approach within AI that emphasizes the use of data to train models.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Techniques
<ul>
<li>AI includes a variety of methods beyond just ML, such as rule-based systems, search algorithms, and symbolic AI.</li>
<li>ML specifically involves statistical techniques and algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implementation
<ul>
<li>AI systems might use ML as one of their components but can also include other approaches to intelligence.</li>
<li>ML relies heavily on data and algorithms to learn patterns and make decisions without explicit programming for each task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Applications
<ul>
<li>AI applications can be broader and more diverse, including anything from autonomous robotics to game playing to natural language understanding.</li>
<li>ML applications are often centered around tasks like predictive analytics, recommendation systems, image and speech recognition, and language translation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-is-a-model-in-the-context-of-ai-and-ml"><a class="to-underline" href="#what-is-a-model-in-the-context-of-ai-and-ml">What is a “model” in the context of AI and ML?</a></h2>
<p>In the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a “model” is a set of rules or patterns that a computer program uses to make predictions, classify data, or make decisions. Think of a model like a recipe for making a cake. The recipe tells us what ingredients to use, how to mix them together, and what temperature to bake the cake at. If we follow the recipe correctly, we’ll get a delicious cake!</p>
<p>The rules or patterns are typically represented as mathematical equations or algorithms that are used to make predictions or decisions based on input data. AI models utilize various algorithms to process relevant data inputs in order to accomplish their designated tasks or produce the intended outputs. Various types of AI models are better suited for specific tasks or domains where their unique decision-making logic is most effective and relevant.</p>
<h3 id="does-a-model-refer-to-an-algorithm"><a class="to-underline" href="#does-a-model-refer-to-an-algorithm">Does a model refer to an algorithm?</a></h3>
<p>No, a model does not refer to an algorithm. While a model and an algorithm are closely related in the context of AI and ML, they are not the same thing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Algorithm</strong>: An algorithm is a set of rules or a procedure for solving a problem. The algorithm addresses the problem of uncovering patterns, correlations, and relationships within the given data. Through this process, it learns how various <strong>features</strong><a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-1"><sup id="back-to-1">1</sup></a> (input variables) are connected to the <strong>labels</strong><a href="#ref-2" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-2"><sup id="back-to-2">2</sup></a> or target variable (output). It is the method or technique used to process data and <em>train a model</em>. Algorithms define how the data is analyzed and how the learning process is carried out. In short, we apply algorithms to a dataset to achieve a specific function or purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Model</strong>: A model, on the other hand, <em>is the result of applying an algorithm to data</em>. Simply put, models are the output of an algorithm that has been applied to a dataset. It is a mathematical representation of patterns learned from training data. The model can then be used to make predictions or decisions based on new data.</li>
</ul>
<p>In simple terms, an AI model is used to make predictions or decisions, while an algorithm is the logic that enables the AI model to function.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-ml-or-dl-models"><a class="to-underline" href="#what-are-ml-or-dl-models">What are ML or DL models?</a></h3>
<p><strong>ML models</strong>: ML models employ learning algorithms to learn patterns from data, enabling them to make decisions or predictions. They are typically categorized into three main types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Supervised learning</strong>: These models learn from labeled<a href="#ref-2" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-2"><sup id="back-to-2">2</sup></a> data, where the outcome is known. Examples include classification and regression models.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear Regression</li>
<li>Decision Trees,</li>
<li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
<li>Random Forests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong>: These models find patterns in data without labeled outcomes. They are used for clustering and association tasks.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>K-Means Clustering</li>
<li>Hierarchical Clustering</li>
<li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong>: These models learn by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on actions taken. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q-Learning</li>
<li>Deep Q-Networks (DQN)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deep learning models</strong>: DL models are a subset of ML models that use <strong>neural networks</strong> with many layers (hence “deep”) to learn from large amounts of data. They are particularly effective for complex tasks such as image and speech recognition.</p>
<p>In summary, ML models are general algorithms designed for pattern recognition and prediction, while DL models use complex neural networks to handle more difficult tasks with higher levels of abstraction.</p>
<h3 id="different-types-of-models"><a class="to-underline" href="#different-types-of-models">Different types of models</a></h3>
<p>There are many different types of models available in machine learning, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some of the most common types of models:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Linear regression model</strong>: A linear regression model predicts a continuous outcome based on input features (a feature is measurable property or variable or attribute).</li>
<li><strong>Logistic regression</strong>: A logistic regression model predicts the probability of a binary outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Decision tree model</strong>: A decision tree model uses a tree-like structure of decisions to predict outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Neural networks model</strong>: A neural network consists of layers of interconnected neurons, where each connection has a weight, and each neuron has a bias.</li>
<li><strong>K-Means clustering model</strong>: A k-Means clustering model partitions data into K clusters based on feature similarity.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag"><a class="to-underline" href="#what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag">What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?</a></h2>
<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a type of language model that combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generation-based language models to create more powerful and accurate models for tasks like question answering, summarization, and other natural language processing tasks. In traditional language models, the model generates text from scratch, whereas in retrieval-based models, the model retrieves relevant text snippets from a database or a large corpus<a href="#ref-8" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-8"><sup id="back-to-8">8</sup></a> of documents.</p>
<p>Here’s how RAG works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieval component</strong>: When a query is made, the model first retrieves a set of relevant documents or pieces of information from a pre-defined knowledge base or corpus. This is often done using information retrieval techniques like TF-IDF, BM25, or dense vector search with embeddings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generation component</strong>: The retrieved documents are then passed along with the original query to a generative model. The generative model (like a transformer-based model) uses this additional context to produce a more accurate and informed response.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Having said that, RAG models use a hybrid approach. They first retrieve relevant text snippets from a database or corpus using a retrieval algorithm, and these retrieved snippets are then provided as input to a generation model, which generates new text that is influenced and informed by the retrieved snippets.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-rag-essentially-needed"><a class="to-underline" href="#why-is-rag-essentially-needed">Why is RAG essentially needed?</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced context understanding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context-rich responses</strong>: RAG models leverage external knowledge, leading to responses that are richer in context and more informative.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic knowledge updates</strong>: Instead of relying solely on pre-trained data, RAG can dynamically pull in the most relevant and up-to-date information, making it more flexible and current.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved accuracy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fact-checking</strong>: By incorporating retrieved documents, RAG models can verify facts and reduce the likelihood of generating incorrect or misleading information.</li>
<li><strong>Domain-specific knowledge</strong>: For specialized queries, RAG can retrieve domain-specific documents that provide the necessary context, improving the accuracy of the generated content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Versatility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple applications</strong>: RAG can be applied to various tasks such as question answering, summarization, translation, and more, making it a versatile tool in natural language processing.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive learning</strong>: RAG models can adapt to new topics or domains by updating the retrieval corpus, making them more adaptable to different use cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource utilization</strong>: By retrieving only relevant information, RAG models can potentially reduce the computational resources needed compared to training a generative model with vast amounts of data.</li>
<li><strong>Focused generation</strong>: The retrieval component narrows down the context, enabling the generative model to focus on producing high-quality responses based on the most pertinent information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>RAG represents a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing by combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models. It enhances the quality, accuracy, and contextual relevance of generated responses, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. The integration of dynamic retrieval mechanisms ensures that RAG models can provide up-to-date and precise information, addressing some of the limitations of traditional generative models.</p>

  <hr>
  <h2>Notes and references</h2>
  <ol>
  <!-- <li>Nil</li> -->
    <li id="ref-1">1. <strong>Feature</strong>: A feature, also known as an <em>attribute</em> or <em>variable</em>, is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. In the context of machine learning, features are the inputs used by models to make predictions. They play a crucial role in determining the performance and accuracy of a model. Features can be thought of as the independent variables that the model uses to learn patterns and relationships within the data. There are various types of features: 1. Numerical features (takes specific integer value, such as the count of sales, etc.), 2. Categorical feature (represent categories without any inherent order. For example, colors [red, green, blue], types of fruits [apple, banana, cherry]), 3. Binary feature (have only two possible values, often represented as 0 and 1. For example, gender [male, female], outcome [success, failure]), 4. Time-based feature (represents temporal data. For example, timestamps, dates, and time intervals). <a href="#back-to-1" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
    </li>
    <li id="ref-2">2. <strong>Label</strong> is an annotation or tag assigned to data points, providing the desired output for training models. Labels are simply the target output or response that a model learns to predict or classify. Labels are crucial in supervised learning, where algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions or decisions. Labels can take many forms, including: class labels, regression labels, and so on. <a href="#back-to-2" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
    </li>
    <li id="ref-3">3. <strong>Model's parameters</strong> are the variables within the model that are adjusted during the training process to minimize the error between the model’s predictions and the actual outcomes. Parameters are learned from the data. They are internal variables within a machine learning model that are adjusted during the training process. These parameters define the model’s structure and behavior, influencing how it maps input data to output predictions. The primary goal of training a model is to optimize these parameters to minimize the error between the model’s predictions and the actual target values. <a href="#back-to-3" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
    </li>
    <li id="ref-4">4. <strong>Recall</strong>: Recall is like being thorough when finding specific items in a large set. Imagine we’re looking for apples in a big fruit basket. Recall measures how good we are at finding all the apples in the basket. If there are 100 apples in the basket, and we find 80 of them, our recall is high because we managed to find a large portion of the apples. <a href="#back-to-4" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
    </li>  
    <li id="ref-5">5. <strong>F1-Score</strong>: F1-Score balances thoroughness (recall) and accuracy (precision). It’s like balancing finding all the apples and making sure you’re only picking apples, not mistaking other fruits for apples. Precision measures how accurate we are when we say I’ve found an apple. If we sometimes pick oranges thinking they’re apples, our precision is lower. So recall is about finding as many of the true positive cases as possible. <a href="#back-to-5" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
    </li>         
    <li id="ref-6">6. <strong>Grand quest</strong>: A quest in general is a journey or a mission undertaken to achieve a specific goal or objective. It can be a physical or metaphorical journey, and it often involves overcoming challenges, facing obstacles, and progressing towards a desired outcome. A grand quest is a particularly significant, ambitious, or epic quest that often requires extraordinary effort, dedication, and perseverance. In this context of AI vs. ML, I used the term "grand quest" metaphorically to describe the ambitious and significant pursuit of creating intelligent machines in the field of AI. <a href="#back-to-6" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
    </li>
    <li id="ref-7">7. <strong>Centroids</strong>: In k-means clustering, a centroid is the mean (average) position of all the points in a cluster. It is the point that minimizes the sum of the squared distances between itself and all the points in the cluster. Centroids act as the center of each cluster. During the k-means clustering process, the algorithm iteratively adjusts the centroids to better fit the data. <a href="#back-to-7" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
    </li> 
    <li id="ref-8">8. <strong>Corpus</strong>: The term "corpus" or "large corpus" refers to a substantial collection of documents or text data that the retrieval component of the system uses to find relevant information. <a href="#back-to-8" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
