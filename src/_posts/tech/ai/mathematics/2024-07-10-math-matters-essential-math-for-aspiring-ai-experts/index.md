# Why Mathematics Matters for AI?

Mathematics is the hidden engine driving the fascinating world of AI and ML. Imagine trying to build a bridge without understanding the principles of physics—that's what AI development would be like without math! The fundamental laws and principles of physics, such as stress, strain, and gravity, are essential for understanding the behavior of physical systems. Similarly, mathematics provides the fundamental tools and techniques for understanding and analyzing complex systems, such as data patterns, probability, and optimization. 

Whether we're a math whiz or a curious newbie, the math concept that's been buzzing around in our brain is probably the key to unlocking AI's incredible abilities. From the *geometry* of self-driving cars to the *algebra* of language processing, math is the thread that weaves together the complex systems and algorithms of AI.

Unlock the secrets of AI with the ultimate math toolkit! While **calculus**, **linear algebra**, **optimization**, **probability**, and **statistics** are the top-tier math subjects for AI implementation, don't worry if you're not a master of them all. Think of it like a recipe for AI success: you only need to know the right ingredients to cook up a masterpiece. Focus on the math topics that spark your curiosity, and you'll be well on your way to creating AI that's the talk of the town! 

Depending on the dish we're trying to cook up, we might need to add a pinch of **random matrix theory** to spice up our machine learning, a dash of **graph theory** to navigate complex networks, a sprinkle of **game theory** to beat our opponents, a simmer of **differential equations** to model real-world phenomena, or a dash of operations research to optimize our workflow. With the right math ingredients, we'll be serving up AI solutions that are the perfect blend of art and science!

By mastering these mathematical concepts, we unlock the true potential of AI and ML, transforming theory into groundbreaking applications. Dive in, and watch as the numbers come alive, powering the future of intelligent technology. Setting out on a journey to understand artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can be both "thrilling" and "daunting"—especially when it comes to the mathematics that support these technologies. If you’re looking to dive into this field of essential mathematics for AI and ML, knowing where to start and how to proceed effectively with your mathematical learning is crucial.

Here’s a structured direction to help you navigate through the essential mathematics for AI and ML:

**Starting with: 1. [Basic Mathematics](#1-basic-mathematics)** (Foundation level)

As part of basic mathematics, we will cover number theory (whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers).

**Next: 2. [Linear Algebra](#2-linear-algebra)** (Most important)

Linear algebra is the first mathematical toolkit we should arm ourselves with. It forms the foundation of how data is structured and manipulated in AI and ML. Here’s a brief look at how linear algebra contributes to AI and ML:

- **Data Representation**
  - **Vectors and Matrices**: Data in machine learning is often represented as vectors (1D arrays) and matrices (2D arrays). For example, a dataset with  `n`  features<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-1"><sup id="back-to-1">1</sup></a> and  `m`  samples can be represented as an  `m x n`  matrix.
  - **Images**: Digital images are represented as matrices (2D for grayscale images, 3D for color images with RGB channels).
- **Linear Transformations**
  - **Feature Transformation**: Linear transformations, represented by matrices, are used to change the representation of data. This includes scaling, rotating, and translating data points.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) use linear algebra to reduce the dimensionality of data, helping to simplify models and visualize high-dimensional data.
- **Optimization Algorithms**
  - **Gradient Descent**: This algorithm, fundamental to training many machine learning models, involves operations on vectors to update parameters iteratively.
  - **Convex Optimization**: Many optimization problems in machine learning, such as support vector machines, rely on convex functions, where linear algebra helps in finding optimal solutions.
- **Neural Networks**
  - **Weights and Activations**: Neural networks are essentially composed of layers of linear transformations (weights as matrices) followed by non-linear activations. Backpropagation, the algorithm for training neural networks, involves matrix and vector operations.
  - **Convolutional Operations**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use convolutions, which are linear operations applied to data structured as matrices.

These are only a few examples of how linear algebra contributes to AI and ML, demonstrating its fundamental role in various aspects of these fields.


<!-- Operations involving vectors, matrices, and tensors are common in neural networks and other ML models. Grasping concepts like vector spaces, matrix transformations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors will give us a solid base to build upon. These concepts are not only theoretical but have practical applications in areas such as image processing, natural language processing, and recommender systems. -->

Key topics:
- Vectors and matrices
- Matrix operations
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Singular value decomposition

**Next: 3. Calculus**

Once we are comfortable with linear algebra, calculus should be our next topic. Calculus, particularly *differential calculus*, is essential for understanding how algorithms optimize and learn from data. It allows us to understand *gradient descent*—an optimization algorithm that is fundamental in training deep learning models. By learning about derivatives and integrals, we will be better equipped to understand the dynamics of machine learning algorithms, especially how changes in data affect the learning process.

Key topics:
- Derivatives and integrals
- Partial derivatives
- Multivariable calculus (for advanced learning)

**Next: 3. Statistics and Probability**

Probability and statistics are crucial for handling and making decisions from data, which is inherently noisy and uncertain. These branches of mathematics help in modeling and evaluating the behavior of algorithms under various conditions. Understanding concepts like *probability distributions*, *statistical tests*, and *bayesian thinking* will empower us to design and evaluate ML models more effectively.

Key topics:
- Probability rules and distributions
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance)
- Hypothesis testing and Bayesian methods

**Next: 4. Discrete Mathematics**

Discrete mathematics introduces us to the logical and structural aspects of mathematics that are important for algorithm design and analysis. This area enhances our understanding of how algorithms function and their limitations, which is essential for debugging and improving AI models.

Key topics:
- Logic and set theory
- Combinatorics
- Graph theory
- Information theory

**Finally: 5. Optimization Theory (Advance Topic)**

Understanding optimization techniques is akin to learning the art of fine-tuning AI models. Optimization in AI is about finding the best configuration of model parameters<a href="#ref-2" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-2"><sup id="back-to-2">2</sup></a> to improve accuracy and performance. Familiarity with concepts like convex optimization and learning various gradient descent methods will serve as your final piece of the puzzle.

Key topics:
- Linear programming
- Convex optimization
- Gradient descent methods

By following this structured path, we not only build a solid foundation in the mathematics necessary for AI and ML but also develop the practical skills to bring our ideas to life. Don't be fooled - this is no sprint<a href="#ref-3" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-3"><sup id="back-to-3">3</sup></a>, but a marathon that requires patience, persistence, and dedication.

# 1. Basic Mathematics

## Number Theory

Before we go into detail explaining all these essential mathematics, let’s first know briefly about number theory and why it is important.

Number theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, especially integers. It provides a framework for solving problems related to patterns, relationships, and cryptography, which are critical components of AI and ML.

- **Cryptography**: Secure communication relies heavily on number theory, particularly prime numbers and modular arithmetic.
- **Algorithms**: Many algorithms in computer science, including those used in AI, are based on number-theoretic principles.
- **Data structures**: Efficient data storage and retrieval methods often utilize concepts from number theory.

Here are different number systems:

### Natural Numbers

hese are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... and so on. Only *positive numbers* are included here.

### Whole Numbers

Whole numbers are non-negative integers, including 0. Whole numbers include all natural numbers, plus zero. The set of whole numbers is: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...

### Integers

Integers include positive and negative natural numbers as well as 0.

### Rational Numbers

A rational number is a number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, i.e., a fraction. It is a number that can be written in the form: `a/b`, where `a` and `b` are integers, and `b` is non-zero.

### Irrational Numbers

Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a fraction. This means they cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers `a/b`, where `a` and `b` are integers and `b` is not zero. It's non-repeating and non-terminating decimals. This means, the decimal form of an irrational number goes on forever without repeating. Think of it like this: if we tried to write out an irrational number's decimal places, we could keep writing forever and never find a pattern or reach the end.

Rational numbers (NOT irrational):

- `0.5` (can be written as `1/2`)
- `0.333333...` (can be written as `1/3`, has a repeating pattern)
- `0.75` (can be written as `3/4`)

Irrational numbers:

- `π` (pi) is `3.14159265...` - the digits after the decimal point never end and never fall into a pattern
- `√2` (`1.41421356...`) - again, the digits keep going forever without repeating

This is why in real-world calculations, we often use approximations of irrational numbers (like using 3.14 for π) since we can't write out their exact value.

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/different-number-systems.png", baseFormat: "png", alt: "Different Number Systems", description: "<b>Figure 1</b>: Different Number Systems.", isLinked: false %}

### Complex and Imaginary Numbers 

#### Complex Numbers

In mathematics, complex numbers are numbers that can be expressed in the form: `a + bi`, where `a` is a real number (a scalar), `b` is a real number (a scalar) and `i` is the imaginary part, which is defined as the square root of -1. 

#### Imaginary Numbers

Imaginary numbers are a subset of complex numbers, and they are numbers that can be expressed in the form: `bi`. Imaginary numbers are often combined with real numbers to form complex numbers. Imaginary numbers are numbers that, when squared, give a negative result. This is fundamentally different from real numbers, where squaring any real number always gives a positive result. 

Imaginary numbers are unique because they allow for the square roots of negative numbers. This extension of the number system is crucial for solving many mathematical and real-world problems that cannot be addressed with real numbers alone. By defining `i` and using it to form other imaginary numbers, we can square these numbers and always get a negative result, thus expanding our mathematical toolkit.

# 2. Algebra

Before we dive into the world of linear algebra, let's take a step back and understand what algebra actually is. Algebra is a lot like arithmetic<a href="#ref-10" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-10"><sup id="back-to-10">10</sup></a>. It follows all the rules of arithmetic, and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

But algebra introduces a new element— the element of the **unknown**. When we were learning arithmetic, the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem. For example, we might have the problem `1 + 2 = ?`. The answer isn't known until we go ahead and do the arithmetic.

The crucial aspect of algebra is that, when we are unfamiliar with a number, we substitute it with a symbol, typically any letter from the alphabet. A really popular letter to choose is the letter `x`. So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: `1 + 2 = "blank"`, and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition. But in algebra, we'd write it like this: `1 + 2 = x`. The `x` is a placeholder that stands for the number that we don't know yet.

What we have here is a very basic algebraic equation. An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal. An equation says: the things on one side of the equal sign have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign. In the `1 + 2 = x` case, our equation is telling us that the unknown values on the side (`1 + 2`) are equal to what's on the other side, which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling `x`.

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/algebraic-equation.png", baseFormat: "png", alt: "Algebraic Equation", description: "<b>Figure 2</b>: Algebraic Equation.", isLinked: false %}

One of the main goals in algebra is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are. We refer to this process as "solving the equations." In this equation, it's pretty straightforward to see that the unknown value is just `3`. Simply adding `1` and `2` on one left side of the equation yields `3 = x`, which is the same as `x = 3`. So now we know what `x` is. It's just a `3`.

Let's take a little complex equation: `x - 2 = 1`. This is exactly the same equation as `1 + 2 = x`, but it has been rearranged so that it's not quite as straightforward to tell what `x` is. To solve `x` in `x - 2 = 1`, add `2` to both sides: `x - 2 + 2 = 1 + 2`, which is equal to `x = 3`. So in algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game where we are given mixed-up, complicated equations, and it's our job to simplify them and rearrange them until it's a nice, simple equation (like `x = 3`) where it's straightforward to tell what the unknown values are.

Now, let's learn some important rules about how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations.

## Rules

**Rule 1: The same symbol/letter can represent different values in different problems**

The first rule we need to know is that the same symbol (or letter) can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values. For example, in the problem (`1 + 2 = x` where `x = 3`) we just solved, the letter x was used to stand for the number `3`, right? 

But x could stand for a different number in a different problem. For instance, we could be asked to solve the equation `5 + x = 10`. For the two sides of this equation to be equal, `x` must have a value of `5`, as `5 + 5` equals `10`. So `x` (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems. 

**Rule 2: A symbol cannot represent different values in the same problem simultaneously**

That's okay, but what's NOT okay is for a symbol to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time!

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/symbol-same-vs-different-problem.png", baseFormat: "png", alt: "Algebraic Equation", description: "<b>Figure 3</b>: Algebraic Equation.", isLinked: false %}

For example, what if we had the equation: `x + x = 10`? This equation says that if we add x to x, we will get `10`. There are a variety of different numbers that we can add together to get `10`.

```text
x + x = 10
6 + 4 = 10
```

But if we had the first x stand for `6` and the second x stand for 4, then x would stand for two different values at the same time, and things could get really confusing!

**Rule 3: Different symbols can be used to represent different values in the same equation**

If we wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time, we need to use two different symbols, like `x` and `y`.

```text
x + y = 10
6 + 4 = 10
```

So in algebra, whenever we see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation, it's representing the same unknown value. Like if we see a really complicated algebraic equation like the one below, where `x` is repeated a lot of different times, all of those `x`s stand for the same value, and it will be our job to figure out what the value is.

Having said that, for any particular equation, we can't use the same letter or symbol to represent two different numbers at the same time; what about the other way around?

**Rule 4: Different symbols can represent the same value if that satisfies the equation**

Could we use two different letters to represent the same number? Yes! Here is an example of that.

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/complex-algeric-equation.png", baseFormat: "png", alt: "Complex Algebraic Equation", description: "<b>Figure 4</b>: Complex Algebraic Equation.", isLinked: false %}

Let's say we have the equation: `a + b = 2`. What could `a` and `b` stand for so that the equation is true? If a was `0` and `b` was `2`, then the equation would be true. If `a` was `2` and `b` was `0`, the equation would also be true. But there's another possibility: if a was `1` and `b` was also `1`, that would make the equation true, right? 

```text
a + b = 2
0 + 2 = 2
2 + 0 = 2
1 + 1 = 2
``` 

So, even though a and b are different symbols and would usually be used to represent different numbers, there are times when they might happen to represent the same number. Indeed, this problem can shed light on a crucial aspect of algebraic symbol usage.

**Rule 5: Variables in an equation can have different valid values depending on the values of other variables**

Did you notice that there were different possible solutions for this equation? In other words, b could have the value 0, 1, or 2 depending on what the value of a was. 

```text
If a = 0 then b = 2
if a = 1 then b = 1
if a = 2 then b = 0
```

Here, `b` can't have two different values at the same time, but its value can change over time if the value of a changes. In algebra, we refer to b as a variable because its value is subject to variation or change. In this equation, both `a` and `b` are variables because their values will change depending on each other's values. 

In fact, it's really common in algebra to refer to any letter as a variable, since letters can stand for different values in different problems. But in mathematics, we will usually just use the word variable when we are talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem.

So far, we have learned that algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but that includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations.

# 3. Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that has revolutionized the way we understand and interact with the world around us. 

It deals with:

- **Vectors** (list of ordered numbers)
- **Vector Spaces** (collections of vectors)
- **linear Transformations** (functions that map vectors to other vectors in a specific way)
- **Systems of Linear Equations** (sets of equations solved simultaneously)

{% aside %}
**Linear Equations**</br>A linear equation is just like a recipe that follows two simple rules:

1. Variables (like x, y, z) can't be multiplied together (no xy, xyz, 2xy - multiplying x and y, even with a **coefficient**<a href="#ref-9" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-9"><sup id="back-to-9">9</sup></a>. 2 is a coefficient)
2. Variables can't be squared or cubed (no x², y³)

Think of it like this:

- You can only add or subtract variables
- You can multiply variables by regular numbers (like 2x or 5y)

Examples of what IS allowed:

- 2x + 3y = 10 (Like saying: 2 apples plus 3 bananas cost $10)
- 4x - y = 5 (Like saying: 4 times something minus another thing equals 5)

Examples of what's NOT allowed:

- x × y = 6 (Can't multiply variables together)
- x² + y = 4 (Can't square variables)

**Definition**: A linear equation is an equation that describes a straight line. It's written in the form `a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + ... + aₙxₙ = b`.

where:
- `x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ` are the variables (unknowns).
- `a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ` are constants (coefficients) which are real numbers.
- `b` is a constant (often called the intercept).

{% endaside %}

At its core, linear algebra is about understanding and working with lines and planes in *higher-dimensional spaces*<a href="#ref-8" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-8"><sup id="back-to-8">8</sup></a>. At its core, linear algebra is about **vectors**. 

## What is a Vector?

A vector is a way to represent data as a *list of numbers*. It's typically represented as an ordered list of numbers. These numbers represent **features** or **characteristics** of something. Think of it like a container holding several values, arranged in a specific order. The order of the numbers matters because each position in the vector corresponds to a specific feature or attribute. Changing the order changes the meaning.  Here's why and how:

**Customer Data**

Let's say a vector represents a customer with three features: age, income, and purchase frequency.

- **Vector 1: [30, 50000, 2]**  This represents a 30-year-old customer with a $50,000 income and 2 purchases.
- **Vector 2: [50000, 30, 2]** This represents something completely different! It implies a customer with an age of $50,000, an income of 30, and 2 purchases. This is nonsensical.

So the order (age, income, and purchase frequency) is crucial for interpretation. Changing it makes the data meaningless.

The power of vectors lies in how easily computers can perform calculations on them. These calculations help in:

- **Similarity Measurements**: How similar are two customers? Compare their vectors.
- **Clustering**: Group similar data points together based on their vector representations.
- **Prediction**: Use vectors as input to models that learn patterns and make predictions.

A vector has two key properties:

- **Magnitude** (how much/how big)
- **Direction** (which way)

Real-World Examples:

- Wind:
  - Magnitude: 30 mph (how strong the wind is)
  - Direction: Northeast (which way it's blowing)
  - Vector Representation: [30 mph, Northeast]

- Driving a car:
  - Magnitude: 40 mph (speed)
  - Direction: North
  - Vector Representation: [40 mph, North]

{% aside %} **Vectors are not just Two-Dimensional Arrays/Lists** </br>A common misconception is thinking that vectors must be stored as two-dimensional arrays (one dimension for magnitude and one for direction) since vectors have two properties (magnitude and direction). This is incorrect! A vector is represented as a single list/array of numbers, where each number represents a component. The magnitude and direction are properties that we can derive from these components - they don't need to be stored separately - all that information is contained in the single list of numbers. {% endaside %}

Having said that, a vector is a mathematical measurement that has both magnitude and direction, often used to represent quantities<a href="#ref-5" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-5"><sup id="back-to-5">5</sup></a>. In linear algebra, vectors are often represented as *arrows*, with the length of the arrow representing the magnitude of the vector and the direction of the arrow representing the direction of the vector.

Think of them as super-powered lists of numbers that can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and combined in countless ways. With vectors, we can represent everything from data points to directions, velocities, and even complex systems. Vectors are a fundamental concept in linear algebra and are used in many areas of mathematics and science. The purpose of the vector is to visually represent a piece of data.

Vector often represented graphically as an **arrow**. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude, and the arrow's direction represents the vector's direction. We can think of it as a displacement<a href="#ref-7" class="reference-link" data-ref="ref-7"><sup id="back-to-7">7</sup></a> or movement from one point to another.

**Example**:

Imagine a vector `v` in a two-dimensional space, starting from the origin `(0,0)` and pointing to the point `(3, 6)`. Graphically, this vector can be represented as:

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/vector_diagram_transparent.png", baseFormat: "png", alt: "Vector diagram (3,6)", description: "<b>Figure 3</b>: Shows a vector `v` that moves `3` steps in the horizontal direction and `6` steps in the vertical direction.", isLinked: false, widths: "[50, 50]" %}

In Figure 1, the vector `v` is shown as an arrow starting at the origin `(0,0)` and ending at the point `(3,6)`. The arrow indicates the direction and length (magnitude) of the vector.

### What is a Vector Space?

A vector space is a collection of vectors that satisfies certain mathematical rules, specifically defined by two fundamental operations:

1. **Vector Addition**: When we add any two vectors in the space, the result must be another vector in the *same space*.
2. **Scalar Multiplication**: When we multiply any vector by a real number (scalar), the result must be another vector in the *same space*.

The term "space" in this context is like a container or environment where vectors live and follow specific for how vectors can behave. It's like a playground specifically designed for vectors where:

- We can add vectors together.
- We can multiply vectors by numbers (scalars).
- The result of these operations stays in the same space.

Like fish need water, vectors need their space.

{% aside %}
**Scalars**: scalars are simply numbers (usually real numbers, but they can also be complex numbers depending on the vector space) that are used to perform operations on vectors to scale or stretch vectors.
{% endaside %}

#### Effects of Scalar Multiplication and Vector Addition

When we multiply a vector by a scalar, we're changing the vector's magnitude (length) but not its direction. Multiplying a vector by a positive scalar changes only its magnitude; the direction remains the same.  However, multiplying by a negative scalar reverses the direction.

Vector addition does change the direction of a resultant vector.  When we add two vectors, the resulting vector points in a new direction determined by the vector sum.  This new direction is different from the direction of either of the original vectors unless the vectors are **collinear** (pointing in the same or opposite directions).  So, direction changes are primarily a result of vector addition, while scalar multiplication affects only magnitude (with the caveat of direction reversal when the scalar is negative).

Let's illustrate "collinear vectors" and their effect on vector addition with examples:

**Scenario 1: Collinear Vectors (Same Direction)**

Imagine we're walking 3 miles east (vector A) and then another 2 miles east (vector B).  Both vectors are collinear—they point in the same direction (east).  The resulting vector (A + B) is 5 miles east. The direction hasn't changed; it's still east.

**Scenario 2: Collinear Vectors (Opposite Directions)**

Now, imagine walking 3 miles east (vector A) and then 2 miles west (vector B).  These vectors are still collinear because they lie on the same line (east-west), but they point in opposite directions. The resultant vector (A + B) is 1 mile east (3 - 2 = 1).  The magnitude has changed, but the direction remains along the same east-west line.

**Scenario 3: Non-Collinear Vectors**

Imagine walking 3 miles east (vector A) and then 2 miles north (vector B).  These vectors are not collinear; they point in different directions. The resulting vector (A + B) will point northeast.  The direction of the resultant vector is different from both the original vectors A and B.  It's a new direction created by the combination of the two.

In short:  If vectors are collinear, adding them just changes the length (magnitude) along the same line. If they are not collinear, adding them results in a vector pointing in a completely new direction.

### Understanding Vectors vs. Matrices

Now that we've got a solid understanding of what vectors are, let's explore how they differ from matrices. Understanding this difference is crucial for working with data and solving real-world problems. Let's break it down using everyday examples that will make these concepts crystal clear.

#### Quick Vector Recap

Think of a vector as a single line of information – like our shopping list. It's a collection of numbers arranged in a single row or column.

**Real-World Vector Example: Our Daily Fitness Stats**:

Imagine tracking our daily exercise routine. Your fitness app might store this information as a vector:

```text
Steps: 8,000
Calories burned: 400
Active minutes: 45
```

This is a vector because it's a single column of related numbers. Each number represents a different aspect of our fitness for that single day.

#### What is a Matrix?

Now, imagine expanding that single column into a full spreadsheet. That's essentially what a matrix is – a table of numbers arranged in rows and columns, like a grid.

**Real-World Vector Example: Weekly Fitness Tracking**:

When we track your fitness data over a week, we create a matrix:

<div class="scroll-x">
    <style>
        #table-1 {
            font-size: 14px;
        }

            text-align: center;
        }
        #table-1 td:first-child {
            font-weight: bold;
            text-align: left;
        }
    </style>
    <table id="table-1">

****Understanding the difference: Vectors in programming vs. mathematical vectors****

A vector in the context of data structures and arrays is a dynamic, resizable array (collection of elements) that allows for efficient random access to elements, supports homogeneous element storage (not heterogeneous), and provides automatic resizing capabilities. Vectors are widely used in programming due to their flexibility and ease of use, making them a fundamental data structure for handling sequences of elements in various applications. It is important not to confuse these programming vectors with mathematical vectors, which are objects with both magnitude and direction used in fields like linear algebra.
{% endaside %}

Linear algebra deals with the study of *linear equations*, *vector spaces*, *linear transformations*, and *matrices*. Linear algebra is hugely fundamental to many applied areas of math, statistics, operations research, data science, and machine learning. When we work with data in any of these areas, we are using linear algebra and perhaps we may not even know it.

{% aside %} **Note**: Displacement is often represented as a vector, which means it has both magnitude (length) and direction. For example, if we move 3 meters north, the displacement vector would have a magnitude of 3 meters and an orientation of north. {% endaside %}

A vector isn't just a mathematical concept; it's a versatile tool with countless practical applications. In physics, think of a vector as a combination of direction and magnitude, guiding us like a compass. In math, it's a way to describe direction and scale on an XY plane, similar to mapping out a journey. Meanwhile, in computer science, a vector transforms into an array of numbers, efficiently storing and organizing data. Whether navigating physical forces, plotting points, or managing information, vectors are essential in various fields. -->

<!-- But linear algebra is more than just vectors. It's about the relationships between them, the transformations that can be applied, and the matrices that govern their behavior. Matrices are the ultimate data structures, allowing us to organize and manipulate vast amounts of information with ease.

{% aside %} **Matrice**: A matrix is an array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. Each entry in the matrix is called an element. 

Some common types of matrices include:
- Square matrix: A square matrix is a matrix with the same number of rows and columns.
- Rectangular matrix: A rectangular matrix is a matrix with a different number of rows and columns.
- Diagonal matrix: A diagonal matrix is a matrix with all elements equal to zero, except for the elements on the diagonal.
- Identity matrix: An identity matrix is a square matrix with all elements equal to zero, except for the elements on the diagonal, which are equal to one.
- Zero matrix: A zero matrix is a matrix with all elements equal to zero.
{% endaside %}

So, whether we're a student looking to gain a competitive edge, a professional seeking to stay ahead of the curve, or simply a curious mind eager to explore the wonders of mathematics, linear algebra is the perfect place to start. Join us on a journey to master the art of data manipulation, and discover the incredible possibilities. -->

<!-- ### Vector in Python

In Python, vectors can be represented using lists or more specialized libraries like NumPy. NumPy provides a much more powerful and efficient way to handle vectors and perform mathematical operations. When working with large datasets or performing complex numerical calculations, NumPy is a crucial library that is highly recommended for optimal results.

{% aside %} 
**Python is slow, but NumPy is not!**

Python may not be the fastest kid on the block when it comes to raw computational speed, as it doesn’t compile to lower-level machine code and bytecode like Java, C#, or C. Instead, it’s dynamically interpreted at runtime, which can slow things down. But here’s the twist: Python’s numeric and scientific libraries are anything but slow. Libraries like NumPy are crafted in low-level languages like C and C++, making them incredibly efficient. Think of Python as the master conductor, orchestrating these powerful libraries to perform complex tasks seamlessly. It acts as the “glue code” that brings together the best of both worlds for your computational needs.

#### Declaring a vector using a list

Using a list is the simplest way to represent a vector in Python. However, it lacks the mathematical operations and efficiency provided by NumPy.

```python {data-copyable=true}
# Declaring a vector using a list
vector_list = [3, 4, 5]

# Accessing elements
print("Vector using list:", vector_list)
print("First element:", vector_list[0])
print("Second element:", vector_list[1])
print("Third element:", vector_list[2])
```

Output:

```text {data-copyable=true}
Vector using list: [3, 4, 5]
First element: 3
Second element: 4
Third element: 5
```

#### Declaring a vector using NumPy

NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides a more efficient and feature-rich way to handle vectors and matrices.

```python {data-copyable=true}
import numpy as np

# Declaring a vector using NumPy
vector_numpy = np.array([3, 4, 5])

# Accessing elements
print("Vector using NumPy:", vector_numpy)
print("First element:", vector_numpy[0])
print("Second element:", vector_numpy[1])
print("Third element:", vector_numpy[2])

# Performing vector operations
vector2 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
sum_vector = vector_numpy + vector2
dot_product = np.dot(vector_numpy, vector2)

print("Sum of vectors:", sum_vector)
print("Dot product of vectors:", dot_product)
```

Output:

```text {data-copyable=true}
Vector using NumPy: [3 4 5]
First element: 3
Second element: 4
Third element: 5
Sum of vectors: [4 6 8]
Dot product of vectors: 26
``` -->

Features are the inputs used by models to make predictions. In other words, features are the attributes or variables that describe the data, such as: Numerical values (e.g., age, temperature), categorical values (e.g., gender, color), textual data (e.g., words, sentences), and image data (e.g., pixels, shapes). They play a crucial role in determining the performance and accuracy of a model. A good feature set can help the model learn meaningful patterns and relationships in the data, leading to better predictions and decision-making. <a href="#back-to-1" class="back-to-note">↩</a>

Parameters are learned from the data. They are internal variables within a machine learning model that are adjusted during the training process. These parameters define the model’s structure and behavior, influencing how it maps input data to output predictions. The primary goal of training a model is to optimize these parameters to minimize the error between the model’s predictions and the actual target values. <a href="#back-to-2" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
