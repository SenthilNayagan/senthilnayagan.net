## What is a "model" in the context of AI and ML?

In the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, a model is a mathematical representation of a process or a system that is used to make predictions or decisions based on input data. Here are some examples of mathematical representations for different types of models:

**1. Linear regression** 

A linear regression model predicts a continuous outcome based on input features (a feature is measurable property or variable or attribute). 

Mathematical representation:

```
y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b 
```

- **y**: Predicted outcome
- **x_1, x_2, …, x_n**: Input features
- **w_1, w_2, …, w_n**: Weights (coefficients) for each feature
- **b**: Intercept (bias term)

**Example:**

Predicting house prices based on square footage (`x_1`) and number of bedrooms (`x_2`):

```
Price = 200 x Square Footage + 50 x Number of Bedrooms + 30,000
```

Components of the equation:

- **Input features** (Square Footage and Number of Bedrooms)
  - These are the characteristics or attributes of the house that are used as inputs to predict the house price.
  - Square footage: Represents the total area of the house in square feet. It is a continuous numerical feature.
  - Number of bedrooms: Represents the total count of bedrooms in the house. It is a discrete numerical feature.
  - These input features are the independent variables that the model uses to learn and make predictions about the house price.

- **Coefficients** (200 and 50)
  - These are the weights assigned to each feature (square footage and number of bedrooms) during the training of the model.
  - The coefficient of 200 for square footage indicates that for each additional square foot of space, the price of the house increases by 200 units (e.g., dollars). For example, if the square footage increases by 1, the house price increases by 200 units.
  - The coefficient of 50 for the number of bedrooms indicates that for each additional bedroom, the price of the house increases by 50 units. For example, if the number of bedrooms increases by 1, the house price increases by 50 units.

- **Intercept** (30,000)
  - The intercept (30,000) is a constant term that adjusts the baseline price of the house.
  - This is the starting value of the house price when all other factors (square footage and number of bedrooms) are zero.
  - It accounts for the base price of the house before considering the contributions from the square footage and the number of bedrooms.

**2. Logistic regression** 

A logistic regression model predicts the probability of a binary outcome.

Mathematical representation:

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/logistic_regression_formula.png", alt: "Logistic Regression Formula", description: "<b>Figure 1: </b>Logistic Regression Formula." %}

```
P(y=1|x) = 1 / 1 + e^(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b)
```

- **P(y=1|x)**: Probability of the positive class (y=1) given the input features
- **x_1, x_2, …, x_n**: Input features
- **w_1, w_2, …, w_n**: Weights (coefficients) for each feature
- **b**: Intercept (bias term)
- **e**: Base of the natural logarithm

**Example:**

Predicting the probability that an email is spam based on the presence of certain keywords (`x_1`) and the number of links in the email (`x_2`):

```
P(Spam = 1|features) = 1 / 1 + e^(2xKeywoard presence + 1.5xNumer of links - 1)
```

**3. Decision trees**

A decision tree model uses a tree-like structure of decisions to predict outcomes.

Mathematical representation:

A decision tree consists of nodes representing tests on features and branches representing outcomes of these tests, leading to leaf nodes with final predictions.

**Example:**

Predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on age and income:

1. If age ≤ 30:
   - If income ≤ 50,000: No
   - If income > 50,000: Yes
2. If age > 30:
   - If age ≤ 50: Yes
   - If age > 50: No

**4. Neural networks**

A neural network consists of layers of interconnected neurons, where each connection has a weight, and each neuron has a bias.

Mathematical representation:

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/neural_network_formula.png", alt: "Neural Network Formula", description: "<b>Figure 2: </b>Neural Network Formula." %}

For a simple neural network with one hidden layer:

- **h_j**: Activation of the j-th neuron in the hidden layer
- **x_i**: Input features
- **w_{ij}, w_{j}**: Weights
- **b_j, b**: Biases
- **f, g**: Activation functions

**Example:**

Predicting whether an image contains a cat or not:

1.	Input layer: Pixel values of the image.
2.	Hidden layer: Neurons with weights and biases.
3.	Output layer: Single neuron with a sigmoid activation function giving the probability of the image containing a cat.

**5. K-Means clustering**

A k-means clustering model partitions data into k clusters based on feature similarity.

Mathematical representation:

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/k-means-clustering-formula.png", alt: "K-Means Clustering Formula", description: "<b>Figure 3: </b>K-Means Clustering Formula." %}

- **k**: Number of clusters
- **C_i**: Cluster i
- **x**: Data points
- **\mu_i**: Centroid of cluster i

**Example:**

Grouping customers into clusters based on their purchase history:

- Feature 1: Number of purchases per month
- Feature 2: Total amount spent per month

The algorithm assigns customers to clusters such that the sum of squared distances between customers and the _centroids_<a href="#ref-7"><sup id="back-to-7">7</sup></a> of their respective clusters is minimized.

# Key concepts

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a type of language model that combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generation-based language models to create more powerful and accurate models for tasks like question answering, summarization, and other natural language processing tasks. In traditional language models, the model generates text from scratch, whereas in retrieval-based models, the model retrieves relevant text snippets from a database or a large corpus<a href="#ref-8"><sup id="back-to-8">8</sup></a> of documents.

Here’s how RAG works:

1. **Retrieval Component**: When a query is made, the model first retrieves a set of relevant documents or pieces of information from a pre-defined knowledge base or corpus. This is often done using information retrieval techniques like TF-IDF, BM25, or dense vector search with embeddings.

2. **Generation Component**: The retrieved documents are then passed along with the original query to a generative model. The generative model (like a transformer-based model) uses this additional context to produce a more accurate and informed response.

Having said that, RAG models use a hybrid approach. They first retrieve relevant text snippets from a database or corpus using a retrieval algorithm, and these retrieved snippets are then provided as input to a generation model, which generates new text that is influenced and informed by the retrieved snippets.

### Why is RAG essentially needed?

1.	**Enhanced context understanding**:
    - **Context-rich responses**: RAG models leverage external knowledge, leading to responses that are richer in context and more informative.
    - **Dynamic knowledge updates**: Instead of relying solely on pre-trained data, RAG can dynamically pull in the most relevant and up-to-date information, making it more flexible and current.

2. **Improved accuracy**:
    - **Fact-checking**: By incorporating retrieved documents, RAG models can verify facts and reduce the likelihood of generating incorrect or misleading information.
    - **Domain-specific knowledge**: For specialized queries, RAG can retrieve domain-specific documents that provide the necessary context, improving the accuracy of the generated content.
3. **Versatility**:
    - **Multiple applications**: RAG can be applied to various tasks such as question answering, summarization, translation, and more, making it a versatile tool in natural language processing.
    - **Adaptive learning**: RAG models can adapt to new topics or domains by updating the retrieval corpus, making them more adaptable to different use cases.
4. **Efficiency**:
    - **Resource utilization**: By retrieving only relevant information, RAG models can potentially reduce the computational resources needed compared to training a generative model with vast amounts of data.
    - **Focused generation**: The retrieval component narrows down the context, enabling the generative model to focus on producing high-quality responses based on the most pertinent information.

RAG represents a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing by combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models. It enhances the quality, accuracy, and contextual relevance of generated responses, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. The integration of dynamic retrieval mechanisms ensures that RAG models can provide up-to-date and precise information, addressing some of the limitations of traditional generative models.

    <li id="ref-1">1. <strong>Feature</strong>: A feature, also known as an <em>attribute</em> or <em>variable</em>, is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. In the context of machine learning, features are the inputs used by models to make predictions. They play a crucial role in determining the performance and accuracy of a model. Features can be thought of as the independent variables that the model uses to learn patterns and relationships within the data. There are various types of features: 1. Numerical features (takes specific integer value, such as the count of sales, etc.), 2. Categorical feature (represent categories without any inherent order. For example, colors [red, green, blue], types of fruits [apple, banana, cherry]), 3. Binary feature (have only two possible values, often represented as 0 and 1. For example, gender [male, female], outcome [success, failure]), 4. Time-based feature (represents temporal data. For example, timestamps, dates, and time intervals). <a href="#back-to-1" class="back-to-note">↩</a>

It captures the patterns and relationships within the data, allowing it to generalize and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Models are the core components of AI systems, transforming data into actionable insights. <a href="#back-to-2" class="back-to-note">↩</a>

    <li id="ref-3">3. <strong>Model's parameters</strong> are the variables within the model that are adjusted during the training process to minimize the error between the model’s predictions and the actual outcomes. Parameters are learned from the data. They are internal variables within a machine learning model that are adjusted during the training process. These parameters define the model’s structure and behavior, influencing how it maps input data to output predictions. The primary goal of training a model is to optimize these parameters to minimize the error between the model’s predictions and the actual target values. <a href="#back-to-3" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
    </li>
    <li id="ref-4">4. <strong>Recall</strong>: Recall is like being thorough when finding specific items in a large set. Imagine we’re looking for apples in a big fruit basket. Recall measures how good we are at finding all the apples in the basket. If there are 100 apples in the basket, and we find 80 of them, our recall is high because we managed to find a large portion of the apples. <a href="#back-to-4" class="back-to-note">↩</a>

    <li id="ref-5">5. <strong>F1-Score</strong>: F1-Score balances thoroughness (recall) and accuracy (precision). It’s like balancing finding all the apples and making sure you’re only picking apples, not mistaking other fruits for apples. Precision measures how accurate we are when we say I’ve found an apple. If we sometimes pick oranges thinking they’re apples, our precision is lower. So recall is about finding as many of the true positive cases as possible. <a href="#back-to-5" class="back-to-note">↩</a>

It can be a physical or metaphorical journey, and it often involves overcoming challenges, facing obstacles, and progressing towards a desired outcome. A grand quest is a particularly significant, ambitious, or epic quest that often requires extraordinary effort, dedication, and perseverance. In this context of AI vs. ML, I used the term "grand quest" metaphorically to describe the ambitious and significant pursuit of creating intelligent machines in the field of AI. <a href="#back-to-6" class="back-to-note">↩</a>

    <li id="ref-7">7. <strong>Centroids</strong>: In k-means clustering, a centroid is the mean (average) position of all the points in a cluster. It is the point that minimizes the sum of the squared distances between itself and all the points in the cluster. Centroids act as the center of each cluster. During the k-means clustering process, the algorithm iteratively adjusts the centroids to better fit the data. <a href="#back-to-7" class="back-to-note">↩</a>
