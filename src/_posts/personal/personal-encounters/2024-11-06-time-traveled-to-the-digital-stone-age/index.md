{% aside %} <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I don't intend to criticize or degrade our government-owned telecommunications service in this post. Rather, it's an honest account of my personal frustration with unreliable data connectivity in today's digital-first world. We all want BSNL to succeed, but there are real challenges that need addressing. {% endaside %}

{% include "toc.md" %}

# The Social Media Sweet Talk

Ever fallen for those inspirational social media posts that make you want to change the world? Well, I did. There I was, scrolling through my feed, reading about how BSNL (our government-owned telecom provider) was the underdog hero we needed to support. <span style="color: #FF6B6B">"A lakh people port to BSNL daily!"</span> they said. <span style="color: #FF6B6B">"Be part of the revolution!"</span> they said. And like a fish taking the bait, I jumped right in.

# The "Quick" Switch (Or How I Impulsively Complicated My Life)

Picture this: I'm casually walking past a BSNL office with a friend, probably discussing lunch plans. Suddenly, my inner patriot awakens, and before my brain could send emergency signals to stop, I'm standing in line to port my number. The process was suspiciously simple - 5-10 minutes for a new SIM card. The staff mentioned something about <span style="color: #E74C3C">"3G service with a future 4G upgrade"</span>, and I nodded like someone who totally knew what they were getting into. Spoiler alert: I didn't.

# Warning Signs I Ignored (Because Who Needs Common Sense?)

You know how in horror movies, there are always people warning the protagonist not to go into the haunted house? Well:
- <strong>My wife</strong> (saved as "My Life" in my phone contacts) (the voice of reason I should have listened to)
- <strong>My friend</strong> (another voice of reason I ignored)
- <strong>The BSNL staff</strong> literally telling me <span style="color: #E74C3C">"3G for now"</span> (in 2024!)

But did I listen? Nope! I was too busy imagining myself as a digital revolutionary.

## The "E" for "Extremely Slow" Era Begins

Remember the good old days when we had to wait five minutes for a single webpage to load? No? Well, I got a refresher course! Stepping outside my WiFi zone was like entering a time machine. Suddenly, my smartphone transformed into a not-so-smart phone, proudly displaying the <span style="color: #E74C3C">'E'</span> symbol (E for "Error in Judgment" in my case).

Here's the weird part: the network seems to be playing a bizarre game of hide and seek. One moment, you're standing in a spot with a perfect LTE signal, feeling like you've finally made it to the modern era. Then, <span style="color: #E74C3C">take three steps to the left</span>, and boom! You're back to 'E'. Take two steps right? Back to LTE! It's like playing a twisted version of digital hopscotch where every square has a different decade of mobile technology. I've actually become quite good at the <span style="color: #3498DB">"LTE dance"</span> - that peculiar shuffle you do trying to find that sweet spot where your signal bars align just right.

And let me be crystal clear: I am not joking or <span style="color: #E74C3C">exaggerating</span> here. If you think I'm making this up for dramatic effect, just visit my apartment complex. Stand at my front door: LTE. Walk to my car: E. Take three steps toward the gate: LTE again. Take two steps back: welcome back to E! At this point, I've memorized every sweet spot in my daily route like a digital treasure map. <span style="color: #3498DB">"Oh, you need to make an important call? Let me guide you to that one magical spot between the parking pole and the garden bench - just don't move an inch once you get there!"</span>

## The Great UPI Payment Disaster (Or How I Became Known as "The Cash Guy")

Picture this: I'm at the salon, looking fresh, feeling good, ready to smoothly pay with UPI. But wait! Plot twist:
- Phone: <span style="color: #3498DB">"Loading... loading... still loading..."</span>
- Me: awkward smile "Just a minute..."
- Phone: <span style="color: #E74C3C">"Connection timeout"</span>
- Me: more awkward smiling "Would you believe I have a 15-year-old number?"
- Wife (on phone): <span style="color: #FF6B6B">"I told you so!"</span> (She really loves saying that now)

## The Hotel California Situation: You Can Check Out, But You Can Never Leave

Trying to port out of BSNL is like trying to leave a party where the host keeps insisting "just five more minutes".

After weeks of digital torture, I decided to wave the white flag and crawl back to my old provider, VI. You know things are bad when you're desperately missing your ex (service provider, that is).
My great escape plan went something like this:

- Step 1: Type the porting SMS to switch back to VI
- Step 2: Watch the SMS fail to send
- Step 3: Try again... and again... and again
- Step 4: Google <span style="color: #3498DB">"Why won't my BSNL phone let me leave?"</span>
- Step 5: Discover the cruel plot twist - <span style="color: #E74C3C">you're locked in for 90 days!</span>

That's right, folks! It turns out switching from one provider to other was like checking into a 90-day mandatory stay hotel. And just when I thought I could sneak out early, BSNL pulled out the rulebook: <span style="color: #FF6B6B">"No no, dear customer, you must stay with us for at least 90 days before you can even think about going back to your precious VI."</span>

So here I am, counting down days like a prisoner marking walls, dreaming of the day I can reunite with my old network that I once complained about but now miss like a long-lost friend. Oh, the irony!

# My New Life as a Two-Phone Person

Yes, I'm now that person who pulls out two phones at meetings. One for showing off my vintage 3G connection, and another for, you know, actually doing things. It's not a phase, mom!

## Daily Adventures Include:
- Playing <span style="color: #3498DB">"Find the Signal"</span> (a fun game where everyone loses)
- Explaining to cab drivers why I can't book a ride
- Watching payment apps load slower than a snail in slow motion
- Perfecting my <span style="color: #FF6B6B">"Oh, let me try my other phone"</span> dance

# Lessons Learned (Because Someone Has to Learn from My Mistakes)

1. If your wife says "maybe try it first," LISTEN
2. Just because social media says everyone's doing it, doesn't mean everyone's doing it right
3. The <span style="color: #E74C3C">"E"</span> in EDGE stands for "Extremely bad life decisions"
4. Always carry cash (or a backup phone, or both, or just don't port to 3G in 2024)

# The Countdown

Two months left in my digital prison. I'm not counting days... okay, I am: <span style="color: #E74C3C">exactly 60 days, 14 hours, and 23 minutes left</span> (but who's counting?). 

In conclusion, sometimes supporting the government means carrying two phones and having a really good story to tell at parties. At least I'm building character, right? RIGHT?

P.S. If you're reading this on a BSNL connection, <span style="color: #3498DB">I'll see you next week when it finally loads completely.</span> ðŸ˜‰
