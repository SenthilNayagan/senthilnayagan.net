Hello! I’m **Senthil Nayagan**, hailing from **India**, a land of vibrant software engineers. I am a seasoned IT professional with years of experience in designing and building complex business solutions. I’ve been working in the ever-evolving world of Data Engineering for the past few years. If I were to describe myself in a few words, I would say that I am a Data Engineer by profession and a Rustacean by interest. When I’m not immersed in data or coding, you can find me sharing insights and explorations on my tech blog, where I connect with fellow enthusiasts and curious minds.

### Open-source software (OSS) and the community

I enjoy working with open-source software (OSS). They are open and free to all. They encourage the free exchange of thoughts. I appreciate the freedom they provide. We (developers) are able to engage in ways that wouldn't be possible otherwise. In the end, they deal with our common problems.

The community and open-source software have been a huge help and source of inspiration for me ever since I began coding. In return, I want to contribute back to the community in whatever manner I can. One thing I can do right away is share my knowledge with others through blogging.

Furthermore, working with OSS keeps me on the cutting edge of technology. The rapid pace of development and the exposure to a wide range of projects and technologies help me stay current and continuously improve my skills. It’s a dynamic environment where learning and growth are constants. 

To give back, I actively participate in discussions, contribute code, and help with documentation.

### My tech-blog journey

When we think about contributing to open-source software (OSS), coding often comes to mind. While writing code is a dynamic way to contribute, it’s not the only option. Writing tech blogs is a powerful tool to share knowledge and support the developer community.

Like many, I used to jot down notes in physical notebooks whenever I learned something new. I found that articulating concepts in my own words helped me understand and remember them better. However, referring back to my notebooks was inconvenient since I couldn’t carry them everywhere. So, I started transferring my notes to Google Cloud Drive, which made them accessible and updatable from any device, whether it’s a phone or an iPad. This convenience led me to take things a step further by writing tech blogs on platforms like WordPress and Medium to document my knowledge and learning.

However, these platforms didn’t quite meet my needs. I wanted a clutter-free blogging experience without ads and without requiring subscriptions from readers or writers. This desire pushed me to create my own blog platform.  I focus on presenting information clearly and comprehensively, so readers can fully grasp the topics without needing to look elsewhere for more information.

Blogging is more than just writing notes. It demands a great deal of work to ensure that the content we put together reaches the target audience. Personally, I enjoy writing technical blogs. It’s been an excellent way for me to learn new things and share that knowledge with others. Through blogging, I not only share my expertise with others but also reinforce my own understanding by articulating ideas clearly. This personal blog is my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, design principles, and coding experiences. I strive to make all my posts as clear and informative as possible, ensuring that readers can grasp the concepts thoroughly.

If you have any suggestions or spot any mistakes, please feel free to let me know!

### Hobbies and interests

I am a person who has been fascinated by various interests and hobbies since childhood. Right from my school days, I used to collect stamps, coins, paper money, and more. As I grew up, my interests and hobbies didn’t fade away; instead, more and more got added to the list, and some of these hobbies have even taken on a professional dimension.

In recent times, I’ve developed a fondness for street photography, capturing the vibrant life and unique moments of everyday scenes. I also enjoy composing and arranging short jingles, blending my love for music with creativity. Additionally, I’ve started collecting brass and bronze idols, appreciating the artistry and cultural significance they hold.

These hobbies provide me with a constant source of joy and inspiration. They allow me to explore new facets of creativity and connect with diverse communities. I look forward to sharing more about these interests in detail soon, diving into the stories behind each passion and how they continue to shape my journey.

Well accomplished if you've made it this far :-)
