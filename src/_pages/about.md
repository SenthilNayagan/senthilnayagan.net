Hello! I’m **Senthil Nayagan**, hailing from **India**, a land of vibrant software engineers. I am a seasoned IT professional with years of experience in designing and building complex business solutions. I’ve been working in the ever-evolving world of Data Engineering for the past few years. If I were to describe myself in a few words, I would say that I am a Data Engineer by profession and a Rustacean by interest. When I’m not immersed in data or coding, you can find me sharing insights and explorations on my tech blog, where I connect with fellow enthusiasts and curious minds.

### Open-source software (OSS) and the community

I enjoy working with open-source software (OSS). They are open and free to all. They encourage the free exchange of thoughts. I appreciate the freedom they provide. We (developers) are able to engage in ways that wouldn't be possible otherwise. In the end, they deal with our common problems.

The community and open-source software have been a huge help and source of inspiration for me ever since I began coding. In return, I want to contribute back to the community in whatever manner I can. One thing I can do right away is share my knowledge with others through blogging.

Furthermore, working with OSS keeps me on the cutting edge of technology. The rapid pace of development and the exposure to a wide range of projects and technologies help me stay current and continuously improve my skills. It’s a dynamic environment where learning and growth are constants. 

To give back, I actively participate in discussions, contribute code, and help with documentation.

### Wrting tech-blogs

We often think about coding when we consider OSS contributions. Writing code may be a more engaging way to contribute to OSS, but it's certainly not the only option to give back to the community. Writing tech blogs is a great tool to communicate and exchange knowledge, and it’s immensely helpful for the developer community.

Blogging is more than just writing notes. It demands a great deal of work to ensure that the content we put together reaches the target developers as simply and clearly as possible.

Personally, I like writing technical blogs. Blogging has been an excellent way for me to learn new things and share them with others. Through blogging, I not only share my knowledge with others who are interested in my areas of expertise, but I also share it with myself, in the most clear terms possible.

### My blog

This personal blog is my little corner of the internet where I delve into personal thoughts, share my design and coding principles, and explore a variety of topics. I'm attempting to make all of my posts as clear as possible while yet providing sufficient information for you to grasp the concepts.

### Hobbies and interests

I am a person who has been fascinated by various interests and hobbies since childhood. Right from my school days, I used to collect stamps, coins, paper money, and more. As I grew up, my interests and hobbies didn’t fade away; instead, more and more got added to the list, and some of these hobbies have even taken on a professional dimension.

In recent times, I’ve developed a fondness for street photography, capturing the vibrant life and unique moments of everyday scenes. I also enjoy composing and arranging short jingles, blending my love for music with creativity. Additionally, I’ve started collecting brass and bronze idols, appreciating the artistry and cultural significance they hold.

These hobbies provide me with a constant source of joy and inspiration. They allow me to explore new facets of creativity and connect with diverse communities. I look forward to sharing more about these interests in detail soon, diving into the stories behind each passion and how they continue to shape my journey.

Well accomplished if you've made it this far :-)
